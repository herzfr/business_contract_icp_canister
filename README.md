# Business Contract ICP Canisters

![Logo](https://internetcomputer.org/img/IC_logo_horizontal.svg)

Welcome to your first Azle project! This example project will help you to deploy your first canister (application) to the Internet Computer (IC) decentralized cloud. It is a simple getter/setter canister. You can always refer to [The Azle Book](https://demergent-labs.github.io/azle/) for more in-depth documentation.

This is my first Azle Project ICP Canister, this project replicates decentralized cooperation between two parties, starting from the one proposing work/collaboration to the other party that approves the work/collaboration
